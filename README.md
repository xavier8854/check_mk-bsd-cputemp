# check_mk-bsd-cputemp
The purpose of this script is to provide CPU temperature metrics to check_ml for motherboards who lack IPMI

Simply put it (make executable first) in the directory **/usr/local/lib/check_mk_agent/local/** on the host you're monitoring, then run an inventory on your check_mk host
